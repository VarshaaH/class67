dora the explorer
 One day i was wondering through the forest, and came across a girl named Dora. We started to explore the jungle together, and before long met up with her best friend Boots (who's a monkey).

 Everyday since then we have been meeting up to search all over the jungle for new things to find, little did we know that there was some-one else that was following us. His name is Swiper, and for the reason of that is because what ever we find he tries to swip.
