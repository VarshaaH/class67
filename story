dora the explorer
 One day i was wondering through the forest, and came across a girl named Dora. We started to explore the jungle together, and before long met up with her best friend Boots (who's a monkey).

 n some days Dora's father would send us to the forest to find somethings he needs.

 On this one day he sent us to find 8 carrots, a bag of flour, and 3 eggs.

 First we set off to go over the hills to Dora's vegitable garden, to get the carrots so Dora's father could make his famous carrot cake.

 After we collected the carrot's for the cake, we then took our adventure over the bridge to Dora's grandma's little cottage that was in the wood's.:w2
 Everyday since then we have been meeting up to search all over the jungle for new things to find, little did we know that there was some-one else that was following us. His name is Swiper, and for the reason of that is because what ever we find he tries to swip.s we began our trail across the bridge, no other than swiper apearred from out under the bridge trying to swip our carrots for his dinner. Dora and Boots asked me if i could help them to tell swiper to stop swiping our carrot's. We all began saying to him "SWIPER NO SWIPING", "SWIPER NO SWIPING", swiper then replied "ooohh man", and ran away!
